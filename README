It is a short program that computes reset thresholds (the length of the 
shortest synchronizing word) for all initially connected automata with fixed
number of states and letters.
Generation of initially connected automata is based on the paper of
Marco Almeida, Nelma Moreira and Rogerio Reis "Enumeration and Generation of
Initially Connected Deterministic Finite Automata."

This program was written when I was still an undergrad. Afterwards it
was reused during my PhD program as a basis for futher experiments.
Results that were obtained with this program were used in the following
papers:
1) Dimitry S. Ananichev, Vladimir V. Gusev, Mikhail V. Volkov: Slowly 
Synchronizing Automata and Digraphs.
2) Vladimir V. Gusev: Lower Bounds for the Length of Reset Words in Eulerian
Automata.
3) Vladimir V. Gusev: Synchronizing Automata of Bounded Rank.

I put this code here mostly for historical reasons. I am not going to improve
it.
